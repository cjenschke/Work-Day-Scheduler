# Work-Day-Scheduler
    by Cimarron Jenschke

## Description
    Simple work day scheduler.  Keep track anything you need for your 9-5 work day.  Keep track of what hour it is with a quick visual look.  Red is current hour, green shows future, and gray is in the past.  
    Add your todo in the text box of the hour you want and click the blue save button on the right.
